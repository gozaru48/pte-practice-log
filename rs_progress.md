## Goals

- Achieve at least 80% content word accuracy consistently

## Supplementary Input for Listening and Repetition

Since late May 2025, I have consistently read daily articles from *The Australian* newspaper.  
This practice provides regular exposure to academic sentence structures and authentic phrasing, supporting auditory memory and sentence chunking skills required for Repeat Sentence performance.
